# Configuration

You need **one configuration file** and **one annotation file** to run the complete workflow. You can use the provided example as starting point. Always use absolute paths. If in doubt read the comments in the config and/or try the default values.

- project configuration **(config/config.yaml)**: different for every project/dataset and configures the analyses to be performed
- sample annotation **(config/annotation_example.csv)**:
    - CSV file consisting of five columns
    - no spaces before or after comma
        - name: name of the dataset/analysis (tip: keep it short, but descriptive and distinctive)
        - data: absolute path to the input Seurat object as .rds
        - assay: the Seurat assay to be used (eg SCT or RNA)
        - metadata: column name of the metadata that should be used to group cells for comparison (eg condition)
        - control: name of the class/level that should be used as control in the comparison (eg untreated) or "ALL" to compare every class against the rest (eg useful to find cluster markers; one vs all)
